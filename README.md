# Project name: Segmentation of poor contrast grain boundaries in CT scan images (Master's thesis)
# Introduction
### What is grain boundary?
Most inorganic materials in nature (e.g. common metals, many ceramic, rocks) are polycrystalline structures, which are made of a large number of single crystalites (or grains). Also, the interface of two grains is called the grain boundary. The grain boundaries in a material's microstructure have significant effects on the material's pyhsical properties (e.g. electrical and thermal conductivity). For this reason, it is crucial to analyze the grain structure.
### What is CT scan?
The computed tomography (CT) scans are a fast qualitative diagnostic tool for producing 3D images of materialsâ€™ microstructure. However, the quantitave analyze is commonly necessary for scientific purposes. The quantitative analyse via CT scans might be possible by using image processing methods.
### What is the project?
The aim of the project is to segment the poor contrast grain boundaries in CT scan. You may see an example of a CT scan image in the figure below (1st picture) and its corresponding grain map (ground truth) at the 4th picture.
# Description
In this project, I implemented a convolutional neural networks structure, called the 3D U-Net, to enhance the contrast at grain boundaries of CT scan images (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650 for the details of the 3D U-Net). Then, I implemented a marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm* to complete the segmentation (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing) for the details of watershed segmentation). In the figure below, you may see a slice of output of the 3D U-Net (2nd image) and output of the watershed algorithm (3rd image).

You may see more results of 3D U-Net I employed in this project in the folder 'data'. The images are cutouts from the consecutive CT scan images and their corresponding output. Also, you may find the **weights of the 3D U-Net** I used on the link; https://cloudstore.uni-ulm.de/apps/files/?dir=/Shared/unet_thesis_weights&fileid=12379221#
